# **Invoice Processing - Table Detection & Line-Item Extraction**

This project provides an AI-based solution for detecting tables and extracting line-item details from medical invoices using advanced OCR, NLP models, and deep learning techniques. It leverages cloud services like Google Cloud Vision API for OCR, and transformer-based models for better context understanding, offering high accuracy for both printed and handwritten text.

## **Overview**

The system processes uploaded medical invoices, detects tables and line items, and extracts structured data from them using hybrid OCR and NLP models. It includes a user-friendly interface for validation and error correction, improving the accuracy of medical billing automation.

### **Key Features:**
- Hybrid OCR system using Google Vision API and a custom CNN model for handwritten text.
- Transformers-based NLP model for context-aware extraction and classification.
- Real-time validation and correction through a dynamic web interface.
- Self-learning error correction to improve accuracy over time.
  
## **Tech Stack**

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend**: React.js, TailwindCSS
- **OCR**: Google Cloud Vision API, Custom CNN
- **NLP**: Transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa)
- **Database**: Google Firestore
- **Cloud**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalable model deployment
- **Others**: Docker for containerization, Google Cloud Functions for serverless execution

## **Installation**

### **Pre-requisites:**
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- Google Cloud account with access to Vision API
- Docker (optional)

### **Steps:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sarthak102/Bajaj-HackRx-5.0-Table-Detection-Line-Item-Extraction.git
   cd invoice_processing
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up GCP Credentials:**

   Download your `credentials.json` from Google Cloud and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:/path/to/your/credentials.json"  # Linux/Mac
   $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\credentials.json"         # PowerShell (Windows)
   ```

## **Usage**

### **Running Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
python main.py <folder_path>
```

- Replace `<folder_path>` with the path to the folder containing invoices to process.

### **Running Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

- The React frontend will start at `http://localhost:3000`, allowing users to upload invoices and view results.

## **Google Cloud Setup**

1. **Enable Vision API**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a project or select an existing one.
   - Enable the **Vision API**.

2. **Create Credentials**:
   - Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**.
   - Create a new service account key and download it as `credentials.json`.
   - Set up the environment variable as mentioned above.

## **Deployment**

### **Deploy to Google Cloud Functions:**

1. Package your code and deploy using GCP's `gcloud` CLI:
   ```bash
   gcloud functions deploy invoiceProcessor --runtime python38 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --entry-point main
   ```

2. **Optional: Use Docker** to containerize your application for more control over deployment:

   ```bash
   docker build -t invoice_processing .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 invoice_processing
   ```

### **Frontend Deployment**:
You can deploy the frontend to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or even host it on Google App Engine for a full GCP-based solution.

## **Future Enhancements**

- **AI-Powered Analytics**: Build an analytics dashboard for hospitals to gain insights from the extracted data.
- **Voice Integration**: Enable voice commands to correct or add invoice information.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Securely verify and store invoice data using blockchain.
